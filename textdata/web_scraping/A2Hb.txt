Achaemenid Royal Inscriptions: collection of Old Persian cuneiform texts from the sixth, fifth, and fourth centuries BCE, left by the Achaemenid kings on their official monuments.A2Hb, inscription on column bases from Ecbatana
[Brief Old Persian inscription on column bases. It is interesting to see that king Artaxerxes II Mnemon asks for support from the god Mithra and not, as is common, Ahuramazda.]

apadânam \ stûnâya \ athagainam \ Artaxšaçâ \ XŠ \ vazraka \ akunauš \ hya \ Dârayavauš \ XŠ \ puçâ \ Haxâmanišiya \ Mitra \ mâm \ pâtuv


This audience hall with columns of stone, was made by Artaxerxes, the great king. He, the son of king Darius [II Nothus], the Achaemenid, [says]: May Mithra protect me.
